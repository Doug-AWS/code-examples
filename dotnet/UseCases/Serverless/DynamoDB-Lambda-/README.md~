# Serverless code examples using the AWS SDK for .NET

This folder contains a use case that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store questions and answers.
You pick a question and decide which answer is correct.

Interaction with the database is through AWS Lambda function calls.

This interaction is exposed through Amazon API Gateway,
which uses Amazon Cognito to specify who can call these APIs.

It also uses CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to monitor the operations.

Finally, it includes a React application to present the questions
and answers to users.

## Creating the application

To create the initial code for the app:

- Create a new folder.
  ```sh
  mkdir Serverless
  ```
- Navigate to that folder.
  ```sh
  cd Serverless
  ```
- Run the following command to create a new console application:
  ```sh
  dotnet new console --name DynamoDB-Lambda-
  ```
- Run the following command to add the DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway,
  Cognito, CloudWatch, and X-Ray assemblies to the application:
  ```sh
  dotnet add package AWSSDK.Core AWSSDK.DYNAMODBv2 AWSSDK.LAMBDA AWSSDK.APIGateway AWSSDK.CloudWatch AWSSDK.XRay AWSSDK.CognitoIdentity
  ```
